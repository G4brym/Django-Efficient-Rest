# Django-Efficient-Rest
Started as an alternative to [django-rest-framework](https://github.com/encode/django-rest-framework) with some custom integrations and custom logins to save development time, a ton o time later was migrated to work as a plugin for [django-rest-framework](https://github.com/encode/django-rest-framework) and now is Deprecated.


Still works, the alternative code is still available in older commits.
